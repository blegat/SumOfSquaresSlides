Symmetry reduction for Sum-of-Squares programming

Sum-of-Squares or semidefinite programming allows to provide guaranteed bounds on remarkably many problems.
Although several efficient algorithms exist to solve these programs,
their space and time complexity and even their numerical robustness do not scale well with the size of the polynomial basis or semidefinite matrix.
To alleviate this problem different methods have been developed to reduce constraints with a large basis or matrix into smaller ones.
These exploit sign symmetry or sparsity structure using chordal decomposition.

In this talk we discuss a symmetry reduction approach relying on the invariance of the polynomial under a group of actions.
From the algebraic properties of the group, the SymbolicWedderburn package determines a change of basis that enables the decomposition of the
constraints into smaller bases, some of them being equal which further reduces the problem.
We show how to specify the group symmetry to allow SumOfSquares to perform this reformulation automatically.
