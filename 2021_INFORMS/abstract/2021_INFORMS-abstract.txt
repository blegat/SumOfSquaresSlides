Symmetry reduction in semidefinite optimization

Semidefinite programming naturally come as exact or approximate formulation of many practical applications.
Usually the limiting factor is the size of semidefinite constraints due to much worse algorithmical complexity compared to e.g. linear programming.
To alleviate this problem different methods of simplification of semidefinite programs were devised, e.g. chordal decomposition which is based on sparsity patterns of semidefinite constraints.

In this talk we discuss the approach based on utilising group symmetry to reduce the size of semidefinite problems.
Under such symmetry, one can not only reduce to invariant solutions, but also block-diagonalize the semidefinite constraints which considerably decreases the size and complexity of the problem.
We will then showcase features implemented in SymbolicWedderburn package and its integration with JuMP ecosystem.
