Positivity, symmetry and semi-definite optimization

In this mini-course we will explore connections between algebraic and analytic positivity. Starting with polynomial rings we will show how to use the solution to Hilbert 17-th problem to approximate witnesses of positivity using semi-definite optimization. Such witnesses take form of sum of squares (of rational functions), which form a hierarchy of semi-definite optimization problems which we can solve efficiently. Unfortunately such formulations tend to grow very quickly and soon become computationally intractable. Thus we turn our attention to symmetries of those rings which can provide an elegant way of reducing (via Wedderburn-Artin decomposition) the size and complexity of the optimization problems. Such symmetry reduction may lead to instabilities when performed directly using linear algebra and floating point arithmetic. We will explore ways of using symbolic algebra to avoid those numerical problems and delay the expensive linear algebra computations for as long as possible. Finally we will showcase how to use those methods to bound norm of an operator. If time permits we will showcase two applications: one in quantum information and one in geometric group theory.
